StudySync -- Session Scorer (Ticket 1, Tinker 1B).

TICKET: apply_streak_bonus() works but shouldn't live here -- it belongs in
the shared scoring_helpers module. session_rating() has no test coverage,
and neither function has been checked against bad input.

1. Write a pytest test for session_rating() BEFORE touching anything broken.
2. Move apply_streak_bonus() into scoring_helpers.py and fix the import here.
3. Find 2-3 "breaker" inputs for session_rating() and decide if they need handling.
